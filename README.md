Welcome here

I dont even know what you are doing here and how ended up bc most likely I will not send any links to this repo anywhere. 
Okay great you are reading this, are you still reading?? Why?? I basically have literally nothing to say here. It is just a waste for your time just trust me ._.
Or is it a waste of my time too? People usually be like: "oh shit why did I read this, author has nothing better to do?"
Well YES I have nothing to do okay? Ive already done groceries and stent some time with family, havent touched grass tho yet. 
I have no evil intensions to waste peoples time I am just bored and love writting essays
Could it be called an essay tho? hey... uhhh.. idk if u still reading but try to find my contacts and give some feed on this okay?
Or you are a meanie who just wont care about giving feedback huh, but if you ended up here you really must think this will help you somehow and probably a nice person right?
